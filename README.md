# mympv
My personalized mpv scripts that works for both Windows and Linux

# Introduction
This repo contains several scripts that I have gathered to make mpv works best for my personal needs. 
**Scripts that available in this repository:**
[SmartSkip](https://github.com/Eisa01/mpv-scripts#smartskip), [SmartCopyPaste_II](https://github.com/Eisa01/mpv-scripts#smartcopypaste_ii), [SimpleHistory](https://github.com/Eisa01/mpv-scripts#simplehistory), [UndoRedo](https://github.com/Eisa01/mpv-scripts#undoredo), [thumbfast](https://github.com/po5/thumbfast)

# Installation
[Official MPV installation guide](https://mpv.io/installation/)

**Windows:** copy both [scripts-opts](https://github.com/HattaPauzi/mympv/tree/main/script-opts) and [scripts](https://github.com/HattaPauzi/mympv/tree/main/scripts) and paste it on %APPDATA%/mpv/.\
**Linux:** copy both [scripts-opts](https://github.com/HattaPauzi/mympv/tree/main/script-opts) and [scripts](https://github.com/HattaPauzi/mympv/tree/main/scripts) and paste it on ~/.config/mpv/.\
If there is none, create one.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**\
On Windows, make sure to install the latest MPV version. On my system, using [mpv-x86_64-windows-msvc](https://nightly.link/mpv-player/mpv/workflows/build/master/mpv-x86_64-windows-msvc.zip) from [First-party builds by GitHub CI (latest commit)](https://nightly.link/mpv-player/mpv/workflows/build/master) works flawlessly.
To make the downloaded portable mpv works on PowerShell, make sure to copy its executable directory and paste it on the PATH environments.

# SmartSkip
You think Netflix is good at binge-watching? Yes, it is.. :) But give SmartSkip a try!
Automatically or manually skip opening, intro, outro, and preview, like never before. Jump to next file, previous file, and save your chapter changes!

### Main Features
- **Smart Next / Prev:** Automatically triggers Skip to Silence, Chapter Next/ Prev, or Playlist Next/ Prev based on configurable parameters.
- **Skip to Silence:** If the file you are watching is not chaptered, skipping to silence will attempt to skip the intro and outro by finding the silence in the file (optionally: chapter automatically created).
- **Auto Skip**: If the file you are watching has organized chapters, any opening, ending sound can be automatically skipped after your **preferred countdown** time.
- **Chapters Modification:** Create, remove, edit chapters,  and then save changes into an external file or bake them into the mkv file.
- **Chapter Next / Prev:** Go to next chapter, if no chapters available go to next playlist, and vise-versa (like the good times with MPC-HC).
- **Autoload**: Basically, if you are not using mpv's autoload script, this is bundled along for convenience and for the possibility to add more features in the future.
- **Customization:** Tons of user customizable settings that can even change the behavior and priority of smart-next, smart-prev, auto-skip, and more!
- **OSD** (On Screen Display): Displays a proper OSD for the actions preformed through SmartSkip.
- **More:** This is not all! Explore the conf file to learn more about the possibilities you are missing out...

# thumbfast
High-performance on-the-fly thumbnailer for mpv.

**The script does not display thumbnails on its own,** it is meant to be used alongside a UI script that calls thumbfast.

[Preview of thumbfast on different UIs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42466980/199102896-65f9e989-4189-4734-82a7-bda8ee63c7a6.webm)

## Installation of thumbfast
For the vanilla UI(REQUIREMENT), you also have to install [osc.lua](https://github.com/po5/thumbfast/blob/vanilla-osc/player/lua/osc.lua) (identical to the mpv default, with added thumbfast support) into your `scripts` folder.

### Main Features
No dependencies, no background thumbnail generation hogging your CPU.  
Customizable sizes, interval between thumbnails, cropping support, respects applied video filters.  
Supports web videos e.g. YouTube (disabled by default), mixed aspect ratio videos.

This script makes an effort to run on mpv versions as old as 0.29.0 (Windows, Linux).

### Usage
Once the lua file is in your scripts directory, and you are using a UI that supports thumbfast, you are done.  
Hover on the timeline for nice thumbnails.
